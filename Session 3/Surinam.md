Exercise

To create our first dashboard in Power Bi we are going to use the data file called Surinam.csv, a comma-delimited file with the variable names in the first row of the file. The data are a complete inventory of all the trees in a 60
ha section of forest in Surinam. It is taken from Schreuder et al. (2004) who use it to illustrate applications of survey sampling theory to forestry.

The variable SubPlot records the subplot in which a tree occurred. There are 60 subplots identified by a combination of letter and number.
